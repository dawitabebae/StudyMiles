# StudyMiles/Zeno

StudyMiles/Zeno is a hybrid Web2 + Web3 learning incentive platform. It rewards students with blockchain tokens when they complete learning tasks, helping to gamify education and increase engagement.

## 🎯 Goal
To build a seamless, smart-contract-based incentive system that connects an educational platform (Web2) with a blockchain backend (Cardano), using Marlowe smart contracts.

## 🧩 Components

- **Frontend**: User-facing web interface with a reward box that triggers token distribution.
- **Backend**: APIs to track lesson completion and manage user data.
- **API**: Integration layer between the frontend and smart contract logic.
- **Smart Contract**: Built with Marlowe to securely transfer tokens on task completion.

## 🚧 Current Status

This is a **work in progress**. Due to time constraints and technical onboarding, the full smart contract integration is **not yet complete**. However:

- Frontend, backend, and APIs are functional.
- Marlowe smart contract is written and partially tested.
- The system architecture supports future completion.

## 🗓️ Upcoming

We will complete the remaining integration before pitch day. The full solution will include:
- Wallet role token assignment
- Live deployment of smart contract
- Backend integration to trigger token distribution

## 🤝 Team

- Web2 Developer: Eyuel Chernet and Yohannes Dejene
- Smart Contract Lead: Dawit Abebae and Abel Tesfaye
